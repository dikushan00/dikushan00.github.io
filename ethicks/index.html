            <p class="content_text">
                The scientific edition «Bulletin of the Karaganda University» is committed to adhere closely with the ethical guidelines set by various international organizations i.e. Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICJME) and maintain the high standards of publication process set standards and provide guidelines for best practices in order to meet these requirements.

                The editors of Journal of «Bulletin of the Karaganda University» are responsible for deciding which of the articles submitted to the journal should be published. In evaluating the submitted works, the editors should limit themselves only to the intellectual content. The editors can choose to ignore any material that breaks legal requirements regarding libel, copyright infringement and plagiarism. The editors must ensure the confidentiality of the submitted works until they are published. The publication of an article in a peer-reviewed journal is an essential building block in the development of a logical and valued network of knowledge. It is a direct indication of the quality of the work of the authors and the institutions that support them. Peer-reviewed articles support and exemplify the scientific method. It is therefore important to agree upon standards of expected ethical behavior for all parties involved in the act of publishing: the author, the journal editor, the peer reviewer, the publisher and the society.
            </p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">Duties of authors</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                Authors of scientific work of original research should present an accurate account of the work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance. Underlying data should be represented correctly in the paper. A paper should contain sufficient detail and references to permit others to replicate the work. Counterfeit or knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical behaviour and are unacceptable.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">Originality and plagiarism</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                The authors should ensure that they have written entirely original works, and if the authors have used the work and/or words of others that this has been appropriately cited or quoted. Plagiarism takes many forms, from publishing of another‘s paper as the author‘s own paper, to copying or paraphrasing substantial parts of another‘s paper (without acknowledgment), to claiming results from research conducted by others. Plagiarism in all its forms constitutes unethical publishing behaviour and is unacceptable.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                An author should not in general publish manuscripts describing essentially the same research in more than one journal or primary publication. Submitting the same manuscript to more than one journal concurrently constitutes unethical publishing behaviour and is intolerable. In general, an author should not submit for consideration in another journal a previously published paper.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">Acknowledgement of sources</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                Proper acknowledgment of the work of others must always be given. Authors should cite publications that have been significant in determining the nature of the reported work. Information obtained privately, as in conversation, correspondence, or discussion with third parties, must not be used or reported without explicit, written permission from the source. Information obtained in the course of confidential services, such as refereeing manuscripts or grant applications, must not be used without the explicit written permission of the author of the work involved in these services.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">Authorship of the paper</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study. All those who have made significant contributions should be listed as co-authors. Where there are others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of the research project, they should be acknowledged or listed as contributors. The corresponding author should ensure that all appropriate co-authors and no inappropriate co-authors are included on the paper, and that all co-authors have seen and approved the final version of the paper and have agreed to its submission for publication.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">
                Hazards and human or animal subjects</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                If the work involves chemicals, procedures or equipment that have any unusual hazards inherent in their use, the author must clearly identify these in the manuscript. If the work involves the use of animal or human subjects, the author should ensure that the manuscript contains a statement that all procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and that the appropriate institutional committees has approved them. Authors should include a statement in the manuscript that informed consent was obtained for experimentation with human subjects. The privacy rights of human subjects must always be observed.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">
                Disclosure and conflicts of interest</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                All authors should disclose in their manuscript any financial or other substantive conflict of interest that might be construed to influence the results or interpretation of their manuscript. All sources of financial support for the project should be disclosed.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">

                Fundamental errors in published works</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in his/her own published work, it is the author‘s obligation to promptly notify the journal editor or publisher and cooperate with the editor to retract or correct the paper. If the editor or the publisher learns from a third party that a published work contains a significant error, it is the obligation of the author to promptly retract or correct the paper or provide evidence to the editor of the correctness of the original paper.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">
                Duties of the Editorial Board</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                These guidelines are based on existing COPE Best Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title"> Publication decisions</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                The editor of Journal is responsible for deciding which of the articles submitted to the journal should be published. The corroboration of the work in question and its importance to researchers and readers must always drive such decisions. The editor may be guided by the policies of the journal's editorial board and constrained by such legal requirements as shall then be in force regarding libel, copyright infringement and plagiarism.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">

                Fair play</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                An editor should evaluate manuscripts for their intellectual content without regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, citizenship, or political philosophy of the authors.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">Confidentiality</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                The editor and any editorial staff must not disclose any information about a submitted manuscript to anyone other than the corresponding author, reviewers, potential reviewers, other editorial advisers, and the publisher, as appropriate.</p>
            <p class="content_text content_text_title">
                Disclosure and conflicts of interest</p>
            <p class="content_text">
                Unpublished materials disclosed in a submitted manuscript must not be used in an editor's own research without the express written consent of the author. Privileged information or ideas obtained through peer review must be kept confidential and not used for personal advantage. Editors should recuse themselves (i.e. should ask a co-editor, associate editor or other member of the editorial board instead to review and consider) from considering manuscripts in which they have conflicts of interest resulting from competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of the authors, companies, or (possibly) institutions connected to the papers. Editors should require all contributors to disclose relevant competing interests and publish corrections if competing interests are revealed after publication. If needed, other appropriate action should be taken, such as the publication of a retraction or expression of concern.</p>
